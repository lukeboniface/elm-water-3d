# elm-water-3d

A procedurally generated animating mesh with accompanying water shader written in [elm-lang](http://elm-lang.org).

The project is a rough implementation, heavily inspired by the Wind Waker water effect detailed [here](https://medium.com/@gordonnl/wind-waker-graphics-analysis-a0b575a31127#.fkr4b74it).

## History
This was a Codevember sketch that got a little out of hand and actually ended up taking a few evenings. I was inspired by the Wind Waker water effect and also wanted to try out Functional Programming; this is the result.
